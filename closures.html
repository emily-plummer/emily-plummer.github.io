	<h1 class="post-title">Closures! YAY!</h1>
	<p>I've set off on my Javascript Journey this week! I'm using Codeschool to learn the basics, they've actually got a pretty robust amount of courses to complete the Javascript Class. Right now I'm on Part Three of the Javascript series, after this I'll move on to learning JQuery, Node, Backbone & Angular which are all included courses on the Javascript path. I'm really excited to get moving on these lessons because I can't wait to see all the cool stuff I'll be able to do once I have these skills down! The only enemy is time... </p>

	<p>Today the majority of my focus was spent on closures. They can be a little tricky to wrap your head around at first, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. Codeschool's approach is to get students good at being able to trace closures, I found task 2.4 to be quite challenging. Explaining the steps I went through helps me to cement what I've learned, so I'm going to explain my solution here.</p>

	<h2>Here is the function given, the module asks you to alert to the console the result of the function</h2>

	<p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">var hidden = mystery(3);
var jumble = mystery3(hidden);
var result = jumble(2);

	function mystery(input) {
		var secret = 4;
		input +=2;
		function mystery2(multiplier) {
			multiplier *= input;
			return secret * multiplier;
	}
	return mystery2;
}
function mystery3(param) {
	function mystery4(bonus) {
		return param(6) + bonus;
}
return mystery4;
}</p>
</pre>

<p>Step 1: The hidden variable is declared and assigned mystery(3); This means that mystery is assigned a 
parameter of 3. Input now equals 3, but by the time we get to the inner function, <code>input</code> equals 5.</p>

<p>Mystery2 now equals:
4 * (multiplier*5);</p>

<p>Step 2: The variable jumble is declared and assigned mystery3(hidden). The variable param in
mystery(3) is now assigned ‘hidden’ which evaluates to the return of mystery, which is mystery2.</p>

<p>Step 3: The variable result is declared and assigned jumble(2). This sets the value of bonus to be 2.
The function mystery3 now looks as follows:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-css">function mystery3 (mystery2){
	function mystery4(2) {
		return param(6) + 2;
}</pre></p>

<p>Step 4: Evaluating the return of mystery4 : param(6) sends the value of 6 to mystery2. This means
multiplier is now assigned a value of 6, so mystery2 can be evaluated.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-css">mystery2(6) {
	6 * 5;
	return 4* 30
}</pre></p>

<p>(Returns 120).</p>

<p>This now passes to parameter for mystery3 and now mystery3 can be evaluated.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-css">mystery3(120){
	function mystery4(2){
		return 120 + 2;
}</pre></p>
<p> This evaluates to 122!</p>
</p>
