ruby, rails, and <strong>the moment</strong>

My first introduction to programming was in AP Computer Science, my junior year of high school. I signed up for the class because my older brother had taken it and highly reccommended it, though to be honest I had no idea what I was getting into. I knew pretty much zilch about what programming even was. Spending most of my high school days between hanging out with friends, student government, and sports, programming wasn't even on my radar until I took this class. I think I remember at one point asking my brother if we were going to be taking computers apart and putting them back together...

Anyways, I still remember my teacher (Pevo! a teaching legend!) explaining to us that we were most likely not going to have any idea what we were doing until March or April, if we were really getting it, then maybe January... Maybe.

 MARCH?! This was in September! We were supposed to just type away at things and be OKAY with not knowing what the hell we were doing until MARCH?!! But Pevo explained how magical the moment would be when everything connected. The moment when all the peices come together and you kind of get what you are doing. I thought this was crazy. But I just shut up and waited for *the moment*.


*the moment*

Somewhere between January and February, the moment happened. I can't remember exactly what I was working on at the time, but the moment was clear. It was happening. I was finally <strong><i>getting it</i></strong>. I think if you've ever given any type of coding a try you know exactly what I'm talking about. For me, this is what programming is <strong>all about.</strong> This is why I am pursuing a career in web development. It's why I spend countless hours on the weekend learning and learning and learning some more. This moment is really magic. It's exciting, motivating, and all together <strong>empowering</strong>. 

I just started embarking on learning Ruby again. I went to a few workshops held by RailsBridge (check them out, they are truly wonderful and inspiring.) last school year, but switched gears to focus on front end development. Now I'm back on the Ruby wagon, I just applied to App Academy (a 12 week crash course in full stack development) last week and I'll be preping for the coding challenge over the next few weeks. I had another moment this weekend working with Ryan from <a href="www.openfarm.cc">OpenFarm</a>, a open source project I'm helping with. After having Ryan explain the ins & outs of working with Ruby/Rails for this project, the dots were connecting! I'm still very far away from really getting the big picture, but I'm so motivated and excited to keep learning more and contributing to OpenFarm.

More posts soon on OpenFarm and learning Ruby!



P.S. Shout out to the meat community. You guys have been so supportive and inspiring over the last couple of weeks.
